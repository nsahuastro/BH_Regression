# BH_Regression
Linear regression code to obtain relation between black hole mass and host galaxy properties. This code uses BCES algorithm (Ref. Akritas & Bershady 1996) and provides (Y|X) fit, (X|Y) fit, and  Bisector fit. The relations obtained can be used to predict black hole mass in other distant galaxies.
